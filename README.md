Actor-Critic DDPG with pytorch

Currently setup to work with openAI pendulum-v0, currently testing on other environments


Evaluations:

pendulum - https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_rIs1RhG1RiKuy6uvzCdhAg
pendulum probably had too much noise, training could be sped up some by reducing the explore parameter in noise.py
